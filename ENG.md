### HTML Tag for Image Insertion

In this tutorial, we will create a tag for inserting images into a web page and explain each of its elements step by step.

#### Step 1: Opening Tag
```html
<img
```
This element of the `<img>` tag indicates the beginning of the image insertion.

#### Step 2: src Attribute (Source)
```html
src="image_path.jpg"
```
The `src` attribute specifies the path to the image. It can be either the URL of the image or the path to the file on the server.

#### Step 3: Alt Text
```html
alt="Image Description"
```
The `alt` attribute provides a textual description of the image. It is displayed if the image cannot be loaded or for users who use screen reading software.

#### Step 4: Closing Tag
```html
/>
```
The closing slash `/` indicates that the tag is self-closing.
